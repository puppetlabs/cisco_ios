# Cisco IOS Hands-on-lab

This is a lab which explains how to use this module with [bolt](https://puppet.com/products/bolt). It is similar to the [lab](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-panos/tree/master/docs/01-using-with-bolt) for how to use the module with Palo Alto.

This labs is intended for a new user and covers off only basic capabilities. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
